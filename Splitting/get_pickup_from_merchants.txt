1. Join the merchant Id data to the original data
2. Check for any nulls when right joining on the original data
3. drop the nulls after transferring them to a different dataframe to report missing
4. group data by merchant id
5. For each group detect stationary intervals (without smoothening or tolerance)
6. pick the longest
7. Compare the coordinates (they should all match each other)
8. If not, take the coordinate with a majority vote and search for it in the stationary intervals of the odd trips
