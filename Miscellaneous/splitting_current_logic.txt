1. Group by merchants and take the most-repetitive coordinates to fix outlier coordinates
2. Detect the first occurrence of the pickup coordinates (from the pooling file)
3. Detect stationarity around the time of the first occurrence and identify it as the waiting time
4. Using the indices of the stationary interval, segment the trips into three different segments.


Side note: need to fix the issue of having repeating final ping to avoid introducing wait times
